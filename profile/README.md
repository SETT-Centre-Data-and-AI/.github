# Welcome to SETT: Data and AI üëã
This is the main repository for the Southampton Emerging Therapies and Technologies (SETT) Centre: Data and AI. 

Here we host all our open source projects for the wider research and development community to use.

## Welcome

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Welcome to SETT: Data and AI. Our mission is to bring tomorrows clinical care to today and part of that is sharing open-source tools, modules and papers to accelerate that growth within the NHS and beyond.<br />

Our journey started in 2021 with a very small team of just two but over the last 3 years we have now grown to over 10 in the team. Our job was initially to help extract and provision research for clinical research but this has now morphed into national collaborations, modelling, clinical AI projects, AI-tool vetting and hybrid infrastructure development. 

## SETT: Data and AI Mission

Improve healthcare for clinicians and patients alike through the responsible and careful use of software, artificial intelligence and scalable solution design.

## The Leadership Team üê±‚Äçüèç

- Dr Matt Stammers, who started the team in 2021 is a Consultant Gastroenterologist & Clinician Informatician. He was officially appointed as clinical lead of the data and AI theme in August 2024 and intends to build the theme into a major national contributor to open-source clinical R&D software. He believes passionately that open-source trumps closed-source particularly in NLP projects and wants to see the NHS be able to thrive and grow by embracing safe clinical AI.

- Mrs Rachel Chappell is the SETT Centre manager and is responsible for managing all three SETT themes. She has previously held many roles within the NHS and has an extensive experience as an NHS manager. She has worked closely with Matt over the last three years to build up the theme into the powerhouse that it is becoming today.

- Mr Mike Dahl brings a long term experience of managing R&D workflows.  He is responsible for process and workflow development and manages our client-facing team.

- Dr Michael George, a clinician turned data engineer / data scientist. Michael was the first person to join SETT and together in the early days he and Matt laid the foundations of what would become the infrastructure we have today. Michael is becoming an expert in clinical length of stay prediction and is working with collaborators to build up this capability. He is responsible for managing the infrastructure team.

- Mr Cai Davis has an extensive experience in extracting, provisioning and analysing data for research. Full of energy and ideas he devised the original ribosome model and multiple other innovations. He is also the primary person responsible for naming innovations as he is very gifted in this regard. He leads the analytics and delivery team.
